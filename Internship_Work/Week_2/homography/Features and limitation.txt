Features of the Homograph Detector

Core Detection Capabilities

1) Unicode Homograph Detection
  Identifies visually similar characters across scripts
  Detects Cyrillic, Greek, and other script homographs
2) Mixed-Script Detection
  Flags labels combining Latin + Cyrillic, Latin + Greek, etc.
  Configurable allowed scripts (default: Latin only)
3) Punycode Attack Prevention
  Automatically decodes and analyzes IDNA domains
  Detects homographs in xn-- encoded domains
4) Invisible Character Detection
  Removes and flags:
    Zero-width characters (ZWJ, ZWNJ)
    Directional controls (RLO, LRO)
    BOM and format characters
    Non-spacing marks
5) Skeleton Mapping
  Uses Unicode UTR 39 confusables data
  Normalizes → Case folds → Confusable maps → Skeleton
6) Whitelist Protection
  Compares against trusted domains/strings
  Flags when skeleton matches whitelist but raw differs

Operational Features

7) Automatic Data Management
  Downloads required Unicode data files
  Self-updating with --update-data flag
8) Flexible Integration
  Simple API: is_homograph(label)
  CLI tool for command-line use
  JSON output option
9) Detailed Reporting
  Exact character positions
  Unicode code points
  Script identification
  Mapping explanations
10) Performance Optimized
  Precomputed whitelist skeletons
  Per-label processing
  Cached confusable mappings
11) Customizable Security Policies
  Adjustable allowed scripts
  Configurable whitelists
  Threshold tuning



Limitations

Detection Limitations

1) Script Granularity
  Cannot distinguish between similar scripts (e.g., Hanzi vs Kanji)
  May flag legitimate mixed-script domains (e.g., "café.com")
2) New Confusables
  Requires updates for new Unicode versions
  Zero-day confusables might evade detection
3) Visual Similarity Gaps
  Doesn't implement glyph-based visual similarity
  Some homoglyphs might not be in UTR 39
4) Diacritic Handling
  Flags all unexpected diacritics by default
  No distinction between legitimate and malicious accents
5) TLD-Specific Rules
  Doesn't recognize IDN TLD allowlists
  Treats all domain parts equally


Technical Limitations

6) URL Parsing
  Doesn't automatically split domains/subdomains
  Requires pre-processing for full URLs
7) Character Normalization
  Limited to NFC normalization
  No support for NFKC (compatibility decomposition)
8) Whitelist Dependency
  Effectiveness depends on whitelist quality
  False negatives for unlisted legitimate domains
9) Performance Scaling
  Large whitelists (>100K) impact memory
  No built-in clustering for batch processing
10) Language Support
  Better for European scripts than:
    Right-to-left scripts (Arabic, Hebrew)
    CJK ideographs
    Complex scripts (Devanagari, Thai)



Operational Constraints

11) Update Requirements
  Manual updates for Unicode data
  No automatic version checking
12) No Risk Scoring
  Binary safe/suspicious output
  No confidence scoring
13) UI Integration
  Provides reasons but no visual highlighting
  No built-in "override" mechanism
14)Internationalization
  English-only output messages
  No localization support


#Ideal Use Cases
  Domain monitoring systems
  Login form validation
  Phishing detection pipelines
  User-generated content screening
  Brand protection services


#Less Suitable For
  General natural language processing
  Languages with complex orthography
  Systems requiring granular risk scoring
  Environments with strict performance constraints
  Applications needing real-time visual rendering analysis


#The tool provides robust baseline protection against common homograph attacks while offering enterprise-grade customization options. For maximum protection, combine with:

1. TLD-specific rule sets
2. Visual similarity algorithms
3. Machine learning classifiers
4. Real-time threat intelligence feeds
